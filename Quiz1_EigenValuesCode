#Eigen Values are 1 & 2 which is same as theoretical
#Eigen Vectors are array([[-0.70710678,  0.4472136 ],
#        [ 0.70710678, -0.89442719]])


# Following is the theoretical eigen vectors 
#([[-1,  -0.5 ],
#        [ 1, 1]]) if we scale it equally on same scale as of library both are same. However multiple eigne vectors can exist for eigen values
